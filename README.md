# HiSayCheese - Virtual AI Headshot Studio

## Overview/Vision

HiSayCheese is a virtual AI headshot studio designed to empower users to create professional-quality headshots from their existing selfies with unparalleled ease. Our vision is to provide a seamless and engaging experience that transforms simple selfies into polished, impressive headshots, offering high perceived value. We aim to differentiate ourselves through a captivating visual journey during the enhancement process, transparency in how AI is applied, a suite of free high-quality automated enhancements, and a clear path to premium features for advanced control.

## The Problem

In today's digital world, a professional headshot is essential for online profiles, job applications, and personal branding. However, traditional professional photoshoots can be expensive and time-consuming. Conversely, standard phone selfies often lack the polish and professionalism required, leading to dissatisfaction and missed opportunities. There's a clear need for an accessible solution that delivers high-quality headshots without the associated cost or hassle.

## Our Solution

HiSayCheese offers an innovative solution: users can simply upload a selfie, and our AI-driven platform will automatically enhance it into a professional-looking headshot. This includes intelligent adjustments to the background (replacement or blur), lighting enhancements, optimal framing, and even potential subtle wardrobe tweaks. The process is designed to be quick, intuitive, and yield impressive results.

## Target Audience

*   **Job Seekers:** Needing polished headshots for resumes and online job portals.
*   **LinkedIn Users:** Aiming to enhance their professional presence.
*   **Freelancers & Consultants:** Requiring professional images for websites and proposals.
*   **Students:** Preparing for internships or their first career steps.
*   **Remote Teams:** Seeking a consistent and professional look for team directories.

## Core Concepts

*   **"One-click Headshot Makeover":** This is the cornerstone of our MVP. The goal is to allow users to achieve a significantly improved, professional headshot with minimal effort â€“ ideally, from a single selfie upload.
*   **Visual Enhancement Journey:** We want to make the AI enhancement process transparent and engaging. Users will see a real-time, animated transition: their original selfie, a "processing" stage with visual cues of the AI at work (e.g., a virtual hand appearing to make adjustments), and then the final preview. Explanations of the changes being made will accompany this journey.
*   **Free Automated Enhancement & Premium Manual Controls:** A core set of automated enhancements will be free for all users. For those desiring more granular control, premium features will unlock manual adjustments for various aspects of the headshot.
*   **Human Language Controls:** A future-forward goal is to enable users to make adjustments using natural language commands (e.g., "make the background a bit more blurry," "brighten my face slightly").

## Google Cloud Vision API Configuration

This application uses the Google Cloud Vision API for content moderation (portrait and SafeSearch detection).
To enable this functionality, you must configure authentication by setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

Steps:
1. Create or use an existing Google Cloud Project.
2. Enable the Cloud Vision API for your project.
3. Create a service account.
4. Grant the 'Cloud Vision AI User' role (or a custom role with `vision.images.annotate` permission) to the service account.
5. Download the JSON key file for this service account.
6. Securely store this key file on the server where the backend application runs.
7. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable in your backend application's environment to the absolute path of this JSON key file.

Example: `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-file.json"`

Ensure the backend application has this environment variable set when it starts.

### AWS S3 for Cloud Storage

The application utilizes AWS S3 for storing all uploaded original images and any images processed or enhanced through the platform. This cloud-based storage ensures scalability and reliability.

**Required Environment Variables:**

To connect to your AWS S3 bucket, the following environment variables must be set in the backend application's environment:

*   `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of your S3 bucket (e.g., `my-hisaycheese-images`).
*   `AWS_S3_REGION`: The AWS region where your S3 bucket is located (e.g., `us-east-1`).
*   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID.
*   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key.

These settings are loaded by `config.py`. Ensure these variables are configured correctly for the application to interact with S3. You can set these directly in your shell, or use a `.env` file management system appropriate for your deployment.

**API Responses and Pre-signed URLs:**

When images are uploaded or processed, API endpoints that return image locations (e.g., `presigned_url` in the upload response, `processed_image_path` in enhancement responses) will provide AWS S3 pre-signed URLs. These URLs grant temporary, secure access to the image files stored in the private S3 bucket.

**Local Development with S3 Mocking:**

For local development and testing, S3 interactions are typically mocked (e.g., using `moto` as implemented in the project's tests). When running the application locally with such mocks, you might still need to set the S3-related environment variables (e.g., `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_S3_REGION`, and dummy credentials like `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="testing"`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="testing"`) for the `StorageService` to initialize correctly, even though `moto` will intercept the actual S3 calls. Refer to `config.py` for how these are loaded and for any default fallback values (though for credentials, real or mock values via environment variables are expected for S3 functionality).

### AWS SES for Email Sending

The application uses AWS Simple Email Service (SES) for sending transactional emails, such as account verification emails.

**Required Environment Variables:**

*   `AWS_SES_REGION`: The AWS region where your SES service is configured (e.g., `us-east-1`). This can often be the same as your S3 region.
*   `AWS_SES_SENDER_EMAIL`: The email address that will appear as the sender (e.g., `noreply@hisaycheese.com`). **This email address must be verified in your AWS SES console for the specified region.**
*   `FRONTEND_URL`: The base URL of your frontend application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `https://hisaycheese.com`). This is used to generate links in emails, such as the verification link.

The existing AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) configured for S3 are also used by `boto3` for SES, assuming the IAM permissions are correctly set up. These settings are loaded by `config.py`.

**Local Development with SES Mocking:**

Similar to S3, SES calls are mocked using `moto` during automated tests. For local manual testing where you might not want to send real emails, ensure the application can handle the `EmailService` potentially not sending emails (e.g., if credentials aren't fully set up or the service is conditionally disabled). The `FRONTEND_URL` should be set appropriately in your local environment if you intend to click generated links that point to your local frontend instance.

## User Account Verification

New users registering with HiSayCheese will need to verify their email address to fully activate their account and access all features.

1.  **Registration:** Upon successful registration, the system automatically sends a verification email to the address provided. This email is sent asynchronously to ensure a fast response from the registration API endpoint.
2.  **Verification Email:** The email contains a unique, time-sensitive verification link.
3.  **Verification Process:** Clicking this link directs the user to an API endpoint (`GET /api/auth/verify-email?token=<token>`) that validates the token.
4.  **Access Granted:** If the token is valid and not expired, the user's email is marked as verified in the database. They can then log in and access all protected API resources and application features. If the token is invalid or expired, an appropriate error message is displayed.

Until the email is verified, access to certain protected API endpoints will be restricted.

## Project Naming

*   **Primary Name:** HiSayCheese (utilizing the owned domain `HiSayCheese.com`)
*   **Internal/Alternative Name:** Headshot Handcrafter (as used in `docs/blueprint.md` and internal planning documents)
